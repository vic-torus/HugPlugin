(Not a very creative title, I know...)
For Minecraft 1.12.2 Spigot servers

It's been a while since I've coded, and Java is a new language, so I have no idea if the coding is decent or not.
Also, because I am learning as I go, I tend to go heavy on the commenting... It helps me understand, lol.
I've added a small "update" which allows the command to work on command blocks- even target selectors such as @p work, so /hug @a will hug everybody in that world! Unfortunately, if you're using multiple worlds, command block /hugs will not carry over to other worlds (players, however, CAN hug each other across worlds). I can probably work on this. I'd also like to add the ability for players with the right permission to hug multiple players- this seems simple enough, I'm just still working out how to do it neatly.

Anyhow, if you happen to have found my silly beginner's plugin- enjoy! :D
