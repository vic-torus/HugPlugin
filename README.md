(Not a very creative title, I know...)
For Minecraft 1.12.2 Spigot servers

It's been a while since I've coded, and Java is a new language, so I have no idea if the coding is decent or not.
Also, because I am learning as I go, I tend to go heavy on the commenting... It helps me understand, lol.
I'd like to add the ability for players with the right permission to hug multiple players or even @a- that seems simple enough, I'm just still working out how to do it neatly.
Anyhow, if you happen to have found my silly beginner's plugin- enjoy! :)
